Dropper is a PHP wrapper around the digitalocean.com Application Programming
Interface (API). A link to the API can be found at the end of this document. 
You can also get a copy of the API document using this PHP library. 

You will need to install the PHP curl library (php5-curl on Debian) and JSON
library.

You will need a CLIENT ID/KEY and an API KEY from digitalocean.com before using
this library. Once you have those components you will need to create a 
settings.ini file in this directory and put them in that file. I've include an
example.ini for you to see what is required in terms of data/settings.

There are some "tests" (really examples) found in the test directory that might
help you. 

There is also documentation in the docs directory which you can regenerate with
phpdoc as shown in the DOC readme file.

If you have questions please contact me at adam @t runbymany <dot> com . If you
want to contribute please submit a pull request. 

Thank you for reading this! and enjoy!
