1) I've been contacted to write a clone of DO. I will not. The purpose of
   this library is not to help you create another hosting service. If 
   however you want me to create a custom site for you to manage your Droplets
   locally I'm game. Please reach out to me.

2) The library is licensed GPLv3. If you have a desire/need to license it as
   BSD or a more lenient license then please contact me.
